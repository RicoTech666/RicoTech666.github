    <h1>Xi'an Drum Tower</h1>
    <h2 class="time">November 22, 2019,in Xi'an</h2><br>
    <p>The Drum Tower got its name from the huge drum located within the building. In contrast to the Bell Tower, where bell was stricken at dawn, drum was beat at sunset to indicate the end of the day.<br><br>
  
      It is a two-story post and panel structure, 34 meters (112 feet) high, 52.6 meters (172 feet) long, and 38 meters (124 feet) wide. The architectural style of the Drum Tower is a combination of the styles of the Tang and Qing Dynasties. The Drum Tower also has some unique and innovative features. For example, there are no iron nails used anywhere in the Drum Tower.<br><br>
  
        On the Drum Tower's first floor, lies a hall which hangs many large drums. Each was decorated with intrinsic and beautiful Chinese writing, which symbolizes good fortune. The impressive arrays of drums are only on show and visitors are not allowed to touch any of them.<br><br>
        
        Inside the Drum Tower, there is also a drum museum, where a variety of drums is on display, some of which can be dated back thousands of years. There is a drum show performed here everyday.<br><br>
