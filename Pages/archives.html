      <h2>Hukou Waterfall on the Yellow River</h2>
      <p>
        Hukou Waterfall, the only yellow waterfall on the Yellow River and the second largest in China, is located in
        the Yellow River on the Shanxi – Shaanxi border. The width of the waterfall changes with the season, usually 30
        meters wide but increasing to 50 meters during flood season. When the Yellow River approaches the Hukou
        Mountain, blocked by mountains on both sides, its width is abruptly narrowed down to 20-30 meters. The water
        velocity increases, and then plunges over a narrow opening on a cliff, forming a waterfall 15 m high and 20 m
        wide, as if water were pouring down from a huge teapot. Hence it gets the name Hukou (kettle spout) Waterfall.
